# The task involves reorienting the green spray bottle and dropping it upright into the black pen holder.
# This task can be broken down into three stages:
# 1. Grasp the green spray bottle.
# 2. Reorient the green spray bottle to be upright.
# 3. Drop the green spray bottle upright into the black pen holder.
